Target for 11 sept:-> fix issue and send a apk build to macknly and take a confirmation for web view.
problems: 1. Not much scalable. 2. User Experience: 3. Maintenance 4. Limited Control: can't do much customization 5. whatever in web we can show that only by url. Then there is no point of making design.
